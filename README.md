# Tableau

In this project, I create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set.
I create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set.
My work reflects of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.

The file we use is flights.csv.
Two other files were provided and used used in conjunction with the flights.csv file.
I create three visualizations. 

As I work with the data, I come up with questions I'm curious about and can be answered from the data.
I Build a dashboard to answer my question and lead viewers to that answer.
